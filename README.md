Analysis of a data set of handwritten digits using dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to explore character legibility and recognition

With digitisation continually pervading the professional workplace, as well as the world at large, there is a
growing desire for computer recognition of text in images. This process of converting text images to a
machine-readable format is known as optical image recognition (OCR). Handwriting image recognition
presents a particularly challenging category of OCR as the added complication of individual writing style
must be dealt with. As such, legibility becomes an important aspect of handwriting image recognition, i.e.
how well each character can be distinguished, in the pursuit to optimise character recognition. In this
undertaking we aim to explore a data set of handwritten digits to firstly determine how well we can
recognise and distinguish groups of characters from the others, and followingly to assess the effects of
any typographical changes deemed appropriate on our ability to distinguish between the characters. In order to achieve our objective of grouping the images in the data set before and after any
alterations, however, simple univariate methods were not fit owing to the abundance of features. Therefore, we used a number of multivariate analytical methods instead, namely principal component
analysis for dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering to group the characters. This allowed
measurement of the clustering accuracy, which was compared before and after any typographical
changes were made to quantify their impact.
